# [ATO2] Most Important Cities in Early Game (Updating)

I've created a list of cities you should secure in the early game. Feel free to check it out. Cities are categorized into six regions: Asia, Middle East, Europe, Americas, Africa, and Australia. I've included their economic scale (sum of business and tourism levels) and other details. The order roughly indicates priority (including areas with less competition and easier to capture), but please note this may vary in different situations.
