Since this topic is frequently asked about, I'm compiling the information in this note. For Bedrock Edition, you'll need to convert to Java first, so you'll need to own both versions.

### Requirements
* Minecraft Java Edition
* PC/Mac or device that can run applications
* Java Runtime Environment

Please install any missing requirements.

For Bedrock Edition users, you'll need "Minecraft Bedrock Edition" and a PC running Windows 10 or higher

### Step 1 - Prepare Your World
(I assume you already have a world since you're here to convert it to 3D...)
If you just want to try this out, generating a new world is fine too

Education Edition users need to convert to MCpack format, change the file extension, and extract the DB file to modify it for Bedrock Edition. **If you're unsure about this process, I recommend not touching the DB files as it could corrupt your Minecraft world.**
