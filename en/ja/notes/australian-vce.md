# What is VCE - The Curriculum Offered in Victoria, Australia?

I'm currently a Year 11 high school student attending Peninsula International School Australia in Malaysia since 7th grade. I wanted to organize my thoughts about the "VCE" curriculum from Victoria, Australia that I'm studying, as it's quite complicated.

## What is VCE?
First, VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) is an education certificate provided by Victoria, the Australian state famous for Melbourne.

Australian higher education goes up to Year 12, and VCE takes the final two years to complete, starting after Year 10. As some might notice, VCE is longer compared to other curricula.

Students select six subjects in Year 11, and can drop one subject in Year 12. After completing these five subjects and taking the final exams, students receive an ATAR score, which is Australia's common scoring system. This score can then be used to enter Australian universities.

### About ATAR
Here's a good article about ATAR:

## VCE Advantages and Disadvantages
The biggest advantage of VCE is that it offers **elective subjects**.
Unlike Japan where certain subjects are mandatory, in VCE you can **improve your scores by choosing subjects you're good at** (though some core subjects are required).
Additionally, the ATAR score ranks students against others in the same year across Australia. For example, a score of 80 means you're in the top 20%, 90 means top 15%. This provides a relatively fair measure of academic ability.

The main disadvantage is its high difficulty level. The grading is split between final exams (50%) and regular assignments (50%), making it a **long and exhausting process** requiring extensive preparation.
Also, the final exam is a one-shot opportunity with no retakes, so that score stays with you.
Furthermore, VCE has **much lower recognition compared to IGCSE or IB**, and naturally, ATAR scores aren't widely accepted outside Australia. If returning to Japan, additional tests like TOEFL are required.

Whether it's an advantage or disadvantage, having to complete Year 12 means you **don't need to attend college** (foundation, diploma, or pre-u programs) - though this turned out to be a major disadvantage for me, as I'll explain later.
