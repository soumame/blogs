# Looking Back at Only My Failures in 2023!

I was about to say "Well, another year is ending, it's been a long yet short year," when I received **this mention** in **"Mamee," the Discord community I run**:

*Let's write year-end reflection articles!!!!!!!!
Everyone should write one*

So, I decided to **look back on this year's events**, but rather than seriously writing promotional-like content like "I did this activity!", I thought I'd reflect on some of my **failures** (where methods were wrong or circumstances were bad, and goals weren't achieved) from this year. Since they say **misery loves company**, please enjoy.

## 1: Failed Attempt to Make Money with Learn+ Subscription Service ðŸ˜­
Last year, as a **student ambassador** for the IDEACTIVE JAPAN PROJECT business contest (more like a hackathon), I had the opportunity to do marketing for elementary school students and hosted events using Minecraft. Seeing many elementary school students enjoying Minecraft, I had an idea: **Let's start a business targeting them!**

### Learn+ - Not Exactly Empty, But...
So I started **a service called Learn+** that would provide learning content exclusively to participants. It was like an **online salon** where members would get **exclusive content and videos**. Initially, I thought no one would join, but surprisingly, **several people registered even though there was no content yet.**
From there, I tried to provide content, **but** since it wasn't a company operation and was run only by students with no real business focus, the priority gradually decreased, and **after just a few months, events and content provision stopped.** It kind of faded away gradually. ðŸ˜­

*We used to hold online events in the past.*
