# Looking Back at Only My Failures in 2023!

I wanted to say "Wow, this year is finally ending~ it was a long yet short year," but I received **this mention** in **"Mamee," the Discord community I run**:

*Let's write year-end reflection articles!!!!!!!!
Everyone write one*

So, I decided to **look back on what happened this year**, but since it's not fun to seriously promote things like "I did this activity!", I'll reflect on some of my **failures** (where methods were wrong or circumstances were bad, and goals weren't achieved) that happened this year. Since they say **misery loves company**, please enjoy.

## 1: Failed Attempt to Make Money with Learn+ Subscription ðŸ˜­
Last year, as a **student ambassador** for the IDEACTIVE JAPAN PROJECT business contest (more like a hackathon), I had the opportunity to do marketing for elementary school students and hosted events using Minecraft. Seeing many elementary school students enjoying Minecraft, I had an idea: **Let's start a business targeting them!**

### Learn+ Wasn't Completely Empty... 
So I started **a service called Learn+.** It was like an **online salon** where **exclusive content and videos were provided** to members. Initially, I thought no one would join, but surprisingly, **several people registered even though there was no content yet.**
From there, I tried to provide content **but** since it wasn't run by a company and was just managed by students, and Learn+ wasn't our main job, the priority gradually decreased and **events and content provision stopped after just a few months.** It gradually faded away. ðŸ˜­

*We used to hold online events in the past.*
