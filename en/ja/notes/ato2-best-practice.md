**Note: This article is still being written and content may change.**

After reading various articles and trying different strategies, I'll introduce the most successful methods. Since there are many technical terms, beginners should refer to the wiki.

## Turn 1 (1960s) Strategy

**Buy as many TU104s as possible from the start until they're discontinued**, and lease as many 707-120s as possible. Converting credits to cash is an option if needed.
Purchase 1 707F and create ultra-short-distance routes between major cities to complete 2 cargo quests in the first turn. Purchase more if possible
(Example: London-Paris, New York-Boston, etc.)
When TU104 production ends, replace high-demand routes (monopoly routes between major cities) with 737s and 727s. As income increases, focus on buying DC-8-62s and 707s.

Only lease 707s, no need to purchase them.

Leased 707s **don't contribute to company value** and are **disadvantageous**, so **sell all leases around 1975. Don't use leasing after this.**

## 1971

**Sell all previously purchased TU104s**. From here, switch to **long-distance and cargo focus**.

Routes **over 7000km become profitable**. Move DC-8 series to smaller routes due to lower seat capacity, use 747-100 for Tokyo-London scale routes, and if **peak season profit exceeds 500,000**, develop ultra-long routes like Tokyo-New York. **Sometimes there are big spenders**, so in those cases **give up**. **Aim for second place** instead. **DC-10-30F releases in 1971**. It's an **extremely powerful aircraft**, so buy 10-20 per turn. This urgency is because the economy worsens in 1972, reducing income by half. If funds allow, purchase IL-62Ms and establish routes for future use. Keep the fleet to around 30 aircraft due to low value and satisfaction ratings.

## **1972**

**Economic crisis hits, reducing profits. This is the first major challenge. Weak companies** fail here. **Generally, if managed well, you shouldn't go into deficit**, and should earn at least 150,000 monthly. Note that deficit here means **depreciation costs exceeding total revenue**. Even if you're in the red, other players are likely worse off, so your ranking should improve by just waiting. If possible, continue buying DC-10-30Fs at one per month. Though profitability is low due to economic conditions, this is actually an opportunity for route development.
