Sometimes you just want to create a blog site, right?

These days, you can quickly create a website to your liking without having to use WordPress or similar platforms, even for moderately sized sites. In this tutorial, we'll use **Astro**, a trending framework, to create a blog website in about an hour.

## What is Astro?
Astro is a **framework** primarily designed for building fast websites focused on content delivery (blogs, articles, etc.). It's well-suited for sites that are mainly for viewing content.
It also incorporates the concept of **islands**, which allows you to load JavaScript only for **specific parts** of your site - like making something happen when a button is pressed. To put it simply, it's a framework perfect for beginners because it's **easy to create sites with and highly extensible**.
