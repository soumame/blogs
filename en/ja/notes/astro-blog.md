Sometimes you just want to create a blog site, right?

These days, you can quickly create your own customized website without having to use WordPress or similar platforms for medium-sized sites. In this tutorial, we'll use **Astro**, a trending framework, to create a blog website in about an hour.

## What is Astro?
Astro is a **framework** primarily designed for building fast websites focused on content delivery (blogs, articles, etc.). It's ideal for sites meant mainly for viewing content.
It also incorporates the concept of **islands**, which allows you to load JavaScript only for **specific parts** of your site - like making something happen when a button is clicked. In simple terms, it's a beginner-friendly framework that is **easy to use and highly extensible**.

### What's a Framework?!
If you're wondering what a framework is, think of it as a **development kit packed with useful features**. Using it lets you **skip all kinds of preparation** and jump straight into development.
