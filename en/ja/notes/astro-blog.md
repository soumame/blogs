Sometimes you just want to create a blog site, right?

These days, you can quickly create a custom website without using WordPress or other CMSs, even for medium-sized sites. In this tutorial, we'll use **Astro**, a trending framework, to create a blog website in about an hour.

Astro is a **framework** for building fast websites primarily focused on content delivery (blogs, articles, etc.). It's best suited for content-focused sites.
It also incorporates the concept of **islands**, which allows you to load JavaScript only for **specific parts** of your site - like making something happen when a button is clicked. In simple terms, it's a beginner-friendly framework that is **easy to use and highly extensible**.

### What's a Framework?!
If you're wondering what a framework is, think of it as a **development kit packed with useful features**. Using it lets you **skip all kinds of preparation** and jump straight into development.
