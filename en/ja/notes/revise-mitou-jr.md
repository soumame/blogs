# Reflecting on Mitou Junior

> This article is part of the [Mitou Junior Advent Calendar](https://adventar.org/calendars/10825).

Hello everyone, this is Soumame ([https://tokumaru.work/ja](https://tokumaru.work/ja)). I was attending an Australian international school in Malaysia and graduated at the end of November.
As 2024 is coming to an end, I've been reflecting on various things I've done this year.

Today, I'd like to casually look back on my journey with Mitou Junior, a creator support program that I completed in November this year - from how it started to how it progressed. If you're not familiar with Mitou Junior, please check out their website.

## It Started When I Watched the Mitou Junior Final Presentation
My journey with Mitou Junior goes back over 2 years. In November 2022, I went to watch the final presentations with a friend I had just met that day.

> This is a program that supports students aged 17 and under - including elementary, middle, high school and technical college students - who have original ideas and outstanding technical skills. The Mitou Project is a talent development program run by IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency) under METI, targeting young people under 24. Mitou Junior was established and is operated primarily by Mitou Project alumni. Since its start in 2016, we have received 860 applications and supported/selected 136 creators.

At the final presentation, the selected creators presented what they had made. To be honest, my only impression was that everyone was talking about complex things, and I just thought "Wow, there are so many geniuses gathered here, amazing. Someone like me..." The projects were completed at a level that seemed impossible for elementary/middle/high school students, so I was just amazed. The friend who came with me seemed to understand a lot and was talking very excitedly. Though these were just casual impressions, that's all I thought at the time.
