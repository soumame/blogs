# Reflecting on Mitou Junior

> This article is part of the [Mitou Junior Advent Calendar](https://adventar.org/calendars/10825).

Hello, this is Soumame ([https://tokumaru.work/ja](https://tokumaru.work/ja)). I was attending an Australian international school in Malaysia and graduated at the end of November.
As 2024 is coming to an end, I'm reflecting on various things I've done this year.

Today, I'd like to casually look back on my journey with Mitou Junior, a creator support program that I completed in November this year - from how it started to how it progressed. If you're not familiar with Mitou Junior, please check out their website.

## It Started When I Watched the Mitou Junior Final Presentation
My journey with Mitou Junior goes back over 2 years. In November 2022, I went to watch the final presentations with a friend I had just met that day.

> This is a program that supports students aged 17 and under (including junior high, high school, and technical college students) who have original ideas and outstanding technical skills. The Mitou Project is a talent development program run by IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency) under METI, targeting young people under 24. Mitou Junior was established and is operated primarily by Mitou Project graduates. Since its start in 2016, we have received 860 applications and supported/selected 136 creators.

At the final presentation, creators selected by Mitou Junior presented their creations. To be honest, I only remember everyone talking about complex things, thinking "Wow, there are so many geniuses gathered here, amazing. Someone like me..." The projects were all completed at a level that seemed impossible for elementary, middle, or high school students, so I was just amazed. The friend who came with me seemed to understand a lot and was talking excitedly. Though these were just casual impressions, that's all I thought about it at the time.

## My First Application
Later, when I was in my second year of high school, I **applied** to Mitou Junior with a friend. Although I had no coding skills at the time, we decided to submit an application with an idea for an app we came up with. The proposal was quite rough and lacked feasibility, so we didn't even pass the document screening and were **rejected**. At that time, I thought "Well, that's how it goes."
However, seeing that **friend get accepted** and watching them progress with their project made me feel anxious: **"While others are pursuing what they want to do, I'm just half-heartedly studying at school. Will I never be able to realize what I want to do?"**
In fact, I **had many things I wanted to create** at the time, but there were many things I **couldn't make because I lacked coding skills**. However, I thought I couldn't aim for such heights, and I should just study at school as others told me to, at least to get into university.

### The Following Year
I was attending an Australian curriculum international school, so I was supposed to **study many school subjects** and **get good grades**. Since I had been studying at this school since the first year of junior high school, I needed to study properly as I was behind in language acquisition.
However, being someone who often struggles to concentrate without interest and is easily distracted, I wasn't very focused on school studies. My grades were around the Australian average, but beyond that, I didn't study much for school and was often just playing Minecraft. Also, I think I started to enjoy creating things during this period.
While I could speak English fluently from using it all day, the English I learned was for communication, not the academic English that appears in school tests. Naturally, my English scores weren't very good either. Since I was technically there as an exchange student, I was told to **study properly**.

### Just Doing What I Like
Throughout my second year of high school, I didn't study much and just did what I liked. I spent time **accumulating various experiences** like creating projects with others, making websites, and teaching basic programming to kids as a part-time job. Fortunately, I was surrounded by kind people who provided me with many learning opportunities. By then, I wasn't thinking much about grades and just kept doing what I enjoyed. Although I was criticized by others, looking back now, I think **the knowledge I gained during this time ended up being useful**.
Using the web development skills I learned through about a year of playing around, I even created a site to host Minecraft programming teaching materials. (This became the predecessor to my Mitou Junior project)

### Time to Study Seriously
However, my final **report card before promotion was terrible**. For the first time, I realized that grades really do drop if you don't study. Getting nervous, I decided to stop making websites and **start studying**.
Surprisingly, I actually stuck to this and my grades **steadily improved**. Fear really is important, isn't it? I would wake up at 6:30 AM, go to school, return home at 4 PM, study, eat dinner, and sleep - not extremely intense, but properly consistent. After 3-4 months, my grades became decent, reaching a level where I could potentially aim for overseas universities.

*I made my decision!*

## A Turning Point
**However, an incredible email arrived** while I was studying. A project I had casually submitted, thinking "What if it gets accepted... but no way," was selected for [Mitou Junior](https://jr.mitou.org/).
Unlike the project I submitted the previous year, I had already started working on this one to some extent and had written about something quite practical. Even to me, it seemed technically feasible. Also, being an education-focused project that I was really passionate about probably caught the mentors' attention. I was really happy when it was selected, as it seemed my enthusiasm had been conveyed.

I'm not sure why I applied while focusing on studying, but I think it was because of **that lingering question in my mind: "Is this really okay?"** while studying. Maybe it was my inner self working against doing school studies... (Or you could say that what I wanted to learn just happened not to be at school.)
On the other hand, I still had **anxieties like "Can I really do this? What about school?"** I wondered if it was okay to dedicate my final year of high school to this, so I spent some time considering whether to proceed.

### Feeling Overwhelmed by Others
Having decided to proceed, I focused on creating this app.
**"Even if I go back to studying, I'll always regret it. There are people who will help me, so I should focus on what I want to do."**
I told myself this and devoted myself to studying programming. While others around me were already creating various things and had technical skills, this was my first time making an app, so I was very anxious.
Of course, I had already decided what I wanted to make and had a plan, but I kept questioning whether it was within my capabilities and if I was doing it right. Additionally, seeing my school grades visibly declining was terrifying.

However, Mitou Junior offers a system for school applications through recommendations, so while I initially thought **"If I can't do anything here, it's over,"** I began to think more positively... or perhaps more carelessly, that **"Even if my grades drop because of this, things might work out somehow."**
While thinking "things might work out" isn't necessarily good as things might not work out, it's better than doing nothing due to excessive anxiety...

### The Result
After **a year of exploration and six months of learning and creation through Mitou Junior**, I **completed the program** and received **Super Creator certification**. However, I feel this is just **the starting line**, and what's important is **how I can change myself and the world from here**. In a separate achievement, this software also **won first place in the App Koshien**. While I'm very happy about this as I've **never been first in anything before**, what made me happiest was **having people who appreciated my work**.

The software I presented, **"TutoriaLLM"**, is a self-hosted application that uses AI to help children learn programming and teachers create teaching materials.

I'm developing it with help from people around the world, so I plan to continue as long as people support me. While the software is open source, I'm also considering its use for commercial purposes and hope to implement it in such settings in the future.

## Conclusion
Between us, my grades dropped significantly, so **I don't know if spending my last year of high school this way was the right choice.** However, fortunately, **having many people around me who appreciated these efforts** allowed me to **gain a lot**. While school studies are important, I think it's not bad for the world to have people like me. I've never felt it was pointless. Even things that seem useless can be valuable. (Though perhaps not always efficient)

After finishing school, I struggled with deciding my future path. Having seen various worlds this way, while I used to think "I'll probably go to university" as a matter of course, I sometimes question whether that's really necessary for me (though I am considering university).

I'm grateful to Mr. Nishio, my Mitou Junior mentor, and everyone else, including those who participated in user testing and contributed to software development. Thank you!
