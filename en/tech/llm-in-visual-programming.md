Hello, I'm Soma Tokumaru.
For about a year, I've been deeply involved in Typescript/React web app development, and I'm currently creating a web application called ["TutoriaLLM"](https://tutoriallm.com) that incorporates visual programming, AI dialogue, and real-time code execution features.

https://tutoriallm.com

["TutoriaLLM"](https://tutoriallm.com) has been in development since the beginning of this year, and while it's my first proper application, I'm happy to say it has been selected for [Mitou Junior 2024](https://jr.mitou.org/projects/2024/tutoriallm) and won the AI development division at [App Koshien 2024](https://applikoshien.jp/).

Although I've been submitting it to various external contests, I haven't had many opportunities to explain each feature in detail. Today, I'd like to explore various aspects of integrating LLM into programming education using block programming.

To make this accessible to many people, I'll omit program code details. If you're interested in specifics, please feel free to ask me directly or refer to the GitHub repository. (I might write more in-depth content if there's demand.)

## Integrating LLM into VPL

VPL (Visual Programming Language) is often used for programming education with beginners. With recent improvements in LLM accuracy, I think some people might be considering integrating LLM into VPL.

For example, in this demo developed by Yuta, he achieved direct program creation within the workspace of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly?hl=ja), a VPL developed by Google. The VPLÃ—AI system in TutoriaLLM is quite inspired by this.

## There Was a Problem

However, while the aforementioned demo is well-received by general developers (myself included), user testing revealed that it wasn't very effective when used by children. Like GitHub Copilot, when LLM directly creates programs, humans end up writing less code, and children especially tend to become overly dependent on it, thinking "If AI can write better programs, I'll just let it do everything!" As someone who heavily relies on Copilot myself, I can't entirely criticize this, but for now, let's consider it problematic when children completely delegate tasks to AI without thinking.
