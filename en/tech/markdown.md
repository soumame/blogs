If you've used Google Docs or Word, [![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/16b2c81bd5613af3c43990472054a394.png)](https://gyazo.com/16b2c81bd5613af3c43990472054a394)
you can use buttons like these to select bold, italics, or headings.

However, when using an editor for writing code, those buttons often aren't available, or you might not be able to select text with a mouse.

Markdown is a language ([[markup|markup language]]) that lets you easily express headings, emphasis, and lists by adding simple symbols to text.

You often use it in editors like [[vs-code|VS Code]] or in editors such as Notion and Obsidian, so I made a cheat sheet (there are quite a few of these online, but I wanted one that was a bit simpler).

## タイトル
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

---

## Text formatting

### Bold

```md
**太字にしたい文字**
```

---

## **This becomes bold**

### Italic

```md
_斜体にしたい文字_
```

---

## _This becomes italic_

### Bullet lists

```md
- `-`を入れた後にスペースを入れると
- 箇条書きになります
```

---

- If you put `-` and then a space
- it becomes a bulleted list

---

## Links

```md
[リンクテキスト](https://example.com)
```

---

## [Link text](https://example.com)

There are many other syntaxes, but covering these basics should be enough — you can look up the rest when you need them.
