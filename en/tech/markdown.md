If you've used Google Docs or Word, you can select things like bold, italic, or headings like this:

However, when you use an editor for writing code, there are often no such buttons, or you may not be able to select text with the mouse.

Markdown is a simple language ([[markup|markup language]]) that allows you to express headings, emphasis, and bullet points by adding simple characters to the text.

Even if you're using an editor like [[vs-code|VS Code]], or other editors like Notion or Obsidian, you can use it quite often, so I created a cheat sheet (there are quite a few of these available online, but I thought a simpler one would be nice).

## About Headings

Headings are created using `#`.

There are many other notations, but I think if you cover this much, you can look up what you need later.
