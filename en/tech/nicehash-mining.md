## Downloading and Starting the Software

**Your account has been created! Now, we will download the software to your computer and start mining!**

Follow the link above to download **Nicehash Miner**. It should probably be at the top. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can also use Quickminer (this won't be explained here; if you're unsure, please download Nicehash Miner).

Once downloaded, install it following the instructions. All settings should be fine with the defaults.

If the download completes and you log in, and you can reach a screen like this, you've succeeded.

Now you can use Nicehash.

By pressing the start button displayed on the software (the one that looks like a YouTube play button), it will start mining automatically.
