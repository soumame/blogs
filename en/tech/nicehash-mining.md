I'll explain briefly.

## **What you need**

> 1. A computer

> 2. An email address

## Creating a Nicehash Account

First, go to the official Nicehash website using the link below

[https://www.nicehash.com/](https://www.nicehash.com/)　

Click **GET STARTED**

Enter your email and password as instructed

If you reach a dashboard screen like this, you're done!

## Downloading and launching the software

**Account created! Next, download the software to your computer and start mining!**

Follow the link above and download **Nicehash Miner**. It's probably the top item. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can also use QuickMiner (not covered here). If you're unsure, download Nicehash Miner.

Once downloaded, follow the steps to install. Default settings are fine.

Once the download is complete and you've logged in, reaching a screen like this means success.

You can find your wallet address by opening the Mining tab on the dashboard and clicking the orange button.

Now Nicehash is ready to use.

Press the Start button shown in the software (the one that looks like a YouTube play button) and it will start mining automatically.
