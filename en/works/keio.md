The reasons I chose to go to university were that I wanted connections with people, and compared to high school, I could study more specialized subjects.

By "specialized" I don't mean something like joining a specific lab and writing papers; rather I'm broadly interested in things that run on computers, and at this university there seemed to be more people like that compared to outside schools — that's the level of specialization I meant.

Also, SFC has a system that exempts applicants from the document screening (first stage) if they've obtained Super Creator in the [[ja/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]] program, which I had previously attempted; seeing that they have such initiatives made me feel that there was an atmosphere where my activities would be recognized, so I decided to apply.

## Admission method

Although I was eligible for the first-stage exemption, because I was applying from overseas the timing would have left a gap, so I took the GIGA entrance exam (AO/Winter), which I could take the soonest.

At the time I was in Malaysia, but the GIGA exam could be taken online and (I don't know if this is still the case) could be completed by submitting documents, videos, and a presentation only, which was a great help.

They are also very flexible regarding eligibility for applicants from overseas. On the other hand, unlike the traditional returnee admissions, there are sections to fill in achievements and awards, so it has a somewhat different character from returnee admissions.

Compared to returnee admissions, requirements such as English proficiency and school grades are set a little lower, and it seems they place more emphasis on what you've done so far and what you plan to do once admitted.
