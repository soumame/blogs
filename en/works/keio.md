As for why I went to university, I wanted connections with people, and compared to high school I could learn more specialized things.

By "specialized" I don't mean joining a particular lab and writing papers; I'm generally interested in things that run on computers, and at this university there seem to be more people like that than outside school — that's the level of specialization I mean.

Also, SFC has a system that exempts applicants from the document screening (first round) if they obtain Super Creator status in the [[en/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]] program I previously participated in, and I thought that the existence of such initiatives suggested an atmosphere where my activities would be recognized, so I decided to apply.

## Admissions process

I was eligible for the one-time exemption, but since I was taking the exam from overseas and the timing would be awkward, I took the GIGA Entrance Exam (AO/Winter), which I could take the soonest.

At the time I was in Malaysia, but the GIGA exam could be taken online, and (I don't know if it's still the case) it only required submitting documents, videos, and a presentation, so it was very helpful.

They are very flexible about eligibility for overseas applicants. On the other hand, unlike the traditional admission for returnee students, there are fields to list achievements and awards, so it's a slightly different type of exam compared to the standard returnee exam.

Compared to the returnee exam, requirements for English and school grades are set a bit lower, and it seems to place more emphasis on what you've done so far and what you plan to do after enrolling.
