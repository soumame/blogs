# What is the GitHub Student Pack?

The GitHub Student Pack is the name of a package in which GitHub offers students paid software, free server credits, GitHub Pro plans, and other benefits at no cost.

In Japan, you can use it simply by registering a photo of your student ID or a school-issued email address. I don't know the total value, but there are so many benefits that you can't use them all, so anyone who uses GitHub should definitely sign up. Not signing up is basically a loss.
