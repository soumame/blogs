# What is the GitHub Student Pack?

The GitHub Student Pack is the name of a package through which GitHub provides students with paid software, free server credits, the GitHub Pro plan, and other benefits at no cost.

In Japan, you can use it simply by registering a photo of your student ID or a school-issued email address. I don't know the total monetary value, but there's so much included that you won't be able to use it all, so anyone who uses GitHub should definitely sign up — it's basically a must.
