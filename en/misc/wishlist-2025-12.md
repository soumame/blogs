## Why make a list
- Unfortunately, I don't have enough money to buy everything I want or experience everything I want, so I have to make trade-offs
	- I still live with my parents, so it's not like I'm destitute or can't afford tuition
- I have a habit of buying things I want and see in front of me without thinking carefully
	- On the internet, ads show things I'm interested in, but that doesn't mean they're things I should buy. In fact, in most cases, they're designed to get me to notice them and make me want to buy. It's a cleverly designed system intended to get consumers to buy as much as possible.

On this page I cover not only things I want but also experiences I want

Here's my Amazon list! I'm not asking for anything, but thanks anyway!

## Want to play games
### Steering wheel (racing wheel controller)
- Reasons I want it
	- It's on sale right now (Dec 11)
	- I've wanted one many times before but gave up because I didn't have the space
	- I'm bad at real-life driving, so maybe I could practice a bit
	- I now have the space for it
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- It costs around 40,000 yen. That's expensive for a controller. It's the thing I want most right now, but I might regret buying it if something else comes up
	- It takes up space
	- I haven't been playing games lately, so even if I buy it, it's unclear whether I'll start gaming again
### VR/XR devices
- Reasons I want it
	- A lot of people around me have them
	- I played VRChat on PC a bit
	- A field that seems likely to grow in the future
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- They essentially contain ordinary PC or smartphone hardware, so they're quite expensive
	- I've bought one before and sold it without using it

### Computers
- Reasons I want
	- You can never have too many
	- I want to upgrade my gaming PC (it's gotten a bit outdated)
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- I already have a lot at home and don't feel inconvenienced. Would buying one actually make things more convenient?
	- I already have many: Raspberry Pis, ESP32s, a Mac mini, a MacBook, a desktop PC... Thankfully most were gifts, but I especially haven't had time to make use of the Raspberry Pis.

## Camera (interchangeable-lens)
- Reasons I want one
	- I sometimes borrow one and try it, and it's definitely different from a smartphone
	- Even if I want to take telephoto shots, my current gear (a smartphone & an Osmo Pocket 3) can't do it
	- Friends who own cameras enthusiastically recommend it
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- It's an expensive hobby
	- Buying it doesn't guarantee I'll use it
		- I would understand buying because I'd use it, but there isn't a reason like that right now
	- I might be too busy with university to have time to enjoy it (same as with games)
## Travel
Personally, I think experiences have more value than things you buy with money, and even the items above can become more valuable if you successfully turn them into experiences. For travel, I think that's even more likely and you can get more out of it.

Maybe it would be a bit cheaper if I go with friends.
### Travel around East Asia and return
- Reasons I want this experience
	- I want to explore many places
	- When I lived in Malaysia, there were quite a few places I didn't visit
	- I'd like to visit China, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia, Korea, etc.
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- It costs money. Even more so if you visit multiple countries
	- I haven't thought about when to go
	- The projects I'm working on would be interrupted while I'm gone.
### Domestic travel in Japan
- Reasons I want the experience
	- Despite living in Japan, there are many places I haven't been to
		- I've only visited major cities
	- I want to visit acquaintances who live all over the country and whom I usually only see in Tokyo
	- I like trains, but I'm a casual fan who won't ride them unless I have a reason, so I want to travel by train
- Reasons I'm hesitant
	- Travel, accommodation — all costs are high. For popular, tourist-friendly spots, it can even be more expensive than going abroad
	- Everyone comes to Tokyo anyway, so maybe then...


## Conclusion
- In the end, isn't the solution just to have so much money that impulse purchases don't matter?
	- For now, hoping that I'll have no money problems next year, I bought the steering wheel. A first-year university student who just goes between home and school probably doesn't need a camera... (Besides, I can borrow one on campus anyway.)
