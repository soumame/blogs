Obsidian is way too useful.

## What is Obsidian?
- The basic features are the same as Notion, and you write using [[markdown|Markdown]]
- Notion stores data in a hierarchical manner, while Obsidian structures data through links between notes, etc.
- To be frank, Notion has more features, but Obsidian runs locally and is noticeably lighter than Notion
	- It was perfect for me, since I couldn’t fully take advantage of Notion’s features and wanted certain features or an API
- You can control appearance and behavior with community-developed themes and plugins
