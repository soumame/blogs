Obsidian is incredibly convenient.

## What is Obsidian?
- Its basic functionality is the same as Notion, and you write using [[markdown|Markdown]].
- Notion gives the impression of storing data in a hierarchy, whereas Obsidian structures data through links between notes.
- Frankly, Notion has more features, but Obsidian runs locally & is clearly lighter than Notion.
	- It was perfect for me, as I couldn't fully utilize Notion's features & I wanted specific features or APIs.
- You can control the appearance and behavior with community-developed themes and plugins.
