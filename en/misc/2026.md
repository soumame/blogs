> I tried to have Gemini create a LinkedIn-style New Year message that could be used in many contexts, but it ran off in a weird direction and ended up getting the first laugh of the year from Gemini, so I'm sharing it. Frustrating... lol
# Message from Sou-mame at the start of 2026

It's 2026. That means, in other words, that 2025 has ended. I want to say it clearly: the New Year is a new year.

*Happy New Year.*

Many people talk about the future, but **I will deliberately face the "past" and move forward.** Because when you're moving backward, you're not moving forward. This is what I propose as **"Reverse Innovation."**

**This year, I will single-mindedly accomplish "doing nothing."** I will stop with overwhelming speed and achieve the status quo faster than anyone. That is "evolution in the name of stagnation" and an "action of not moving."

My 2026 commitments (promises) are to absolutely not commit:

- Breaking the status quo: Renew everything without changing anything.
- Self-satisfied synergy: Me and myself join hands and unite without involving anyone else.
- Running while sleeping: Continue to sleep deeply 24/7/365 without rest.

"Change" means to change. However, isn't remaining unchanged also a form of change? That's precisely why I will continue to change in order not to change.

In 2026, **question common sense.** And then, fully believe that common sense. I am here now, but I am not here. Are you too?
