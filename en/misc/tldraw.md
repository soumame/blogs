I found this one because I wanted something free where people can casually brainstorm together without needing something as heavy as Miro.

It uses technologies like [[websocket|Websocket]]? to connect clients, so everyone can edit together (I think the tech behind this is pretty amazing).

There's a similar one called excalidraw. I feel like there are quite a few of these if you look around.
