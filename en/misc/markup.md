I've often heard people say [[html|HTML]] is a programming language, but I've been told otherwise about a hundred times.

To be honest, I thought so myself until recently.

However, in text files like HTML or Markdown, you can't define what happens when you press a button. You also can't do conditional branching.

## What is a markup language
A markup language is a text file that, when opened in a browser, can embed information about which parts are headings, which are bold, where to break lines, and how it relates to other documents.

There are many articles arguing that HTML is not a programming language, so you might want to check those out.
