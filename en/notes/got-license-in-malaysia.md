Hello, I'm Soumame, 17 years old. Recently (well, quite a while ago actually), I managed to get my driver's license in Malaysia, so I'll document how I did it here. First, I should mention that in Malaysia, you can get a regular driver's license from age 17, so please keep that in mind while reading.

> I received questions about getting a license in Malaysia from my acquaintances, so I'm summarizing my personal experiences and impressions.
