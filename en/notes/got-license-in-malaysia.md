Hello, I'm Soumame, 17 years old. Recently (well, quite a while ago actually), I managed to get my driver's license in Malaysia, so I'll document how I did it here. First, I should mention that in Malaysia, you can get a regular driver's license from age 17, so please keep that in mind while reading.

> I'm summarizing my personal experiences and impressions as I received questions from an acquaintance about how to get a license in Malaysia.

## Application
First, you need to decide which driving school to attend. I chose [Metro Driving Academy](https://metrodriving.com.my/en/). I didn't think too much about it as it was recommended by an acquaintance, but it was quite helpful that they offered classes in English. I recommend checking their website or inquiring whether they offer English instruction.
