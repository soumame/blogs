## I participated in a talk session at the Minecraft Cup
先日東京大学(情報学環、福武ホール)で開催された[7th Minecraft Cup](https://minecraftcup.com/)のトークセッションに登壇し、「マイクラからの学びと創造の力」をテーマに、マイクラを通して得たものについて議論しました。
### What is the Minecraft Cup
> [[en/misc/minecraftcup|Minecraft Cup]] is a digital making contest held in Japan for children from elementary to high school age (and under), where participants use Minecraft: Education Edition to create theme-based works, submit entries from across Japan and overseas, and compete against each other.

### Overview of the talk session

I have participated in the Minecraft Cup three times in the past, winning an Encouragement Award at the [[en/accomplishments/minecraftcup-2023|5th Minecraft Cup (2023)]], and qualifying for and receiving an award at the [[en/accomplishments/minecraftcup-2021|3rd Minecraft Cup (2021)]]. I talked about what happened after that.

Along with the announcement that I participated in the talk session, I want to leave a record here about my relationship with the Minecraft Cup and what I gained from Minecraft (especially the Minecraft Cup).

As a rough title related to the Minecraft Cup at the time of this session: a software engineer who, after winning an award at the Minecraft Cup, entered [[en/works/keio|Keio University, Faculty of Environment and Information Studies (SFC)]]. Even calling myself a software engineer feels uncertain these days since we're in an era where AI writes code, so such titles may disappear.

In recent months I was also working part-time with the Minecraft Cup ([[en/works/dmcouncil|Digital Making Council]]), so while speaking as a guest I was actually helping behind the scenes. During the talk session, you can catch glimpses of the staff wearing Minecraft Cup T-shirts peeking out from my hoodie.

I was a little nervous because I had only four hours of sleep the night before from over-excitement and was helping with operations while still inexperienced; also it was a talk session squeezed between scheduled events. Talk sessions are different from presentations because the content isn't predetermined, so it was a fresh opportunity. I couldn't believe I was given such a valuable experience...

## My relationship with the Minecraft Cup

I won an award at the Minecraft Cup in [[en/accomplishments/minecraftcup-2021|2021]]. There were also times when we didn't end up receiving an award ([[en/accomplishments/minecraftcup-2023|2023]]) and a year when we made a project but couldn't submit it (2019). Sometimes things go well, sometimes they don't. The Minecraft Cup (the town development category) is basically a team competition, but teams can have conflicts, fail to coordinate, or lose motivation, and for my team the only year that worked out was 2021.

### What kind of team was it?
We gathered people who were strong technically, those good at design and planning, and people with broad, shallow knowledge beyond Minecraft — essentially a team of people who like the "digital making" mentioned in the name of the organizing body.

Also, the members were a mixed bunch — some not attending school, some unable to do what others consider "normal", and others with extraordinary talents. I, for example, tended to be truant.

Is that bad? Not really. In 2021, because of COVID there were online classes or no school at all, so we had a lot of free time, which became a tailwind and allowed the whole team to happily enjoy digital making with Minecraft.

Another characteristic was that there were no instructors at first. The team formed gradually from playing games with friends, so none of us had been attending programming classes or were forced into it; we were just playing Minecraft with friends we liked, then found a place like this and jumped in, and there were many kind adults who helped us grow... My parents weren't trying to make me play Minecraft, but they didn't completely reject it either. They often said things like "games for 30 minutes a day" like Kagawa Prefecture's ordinance, but they were thinking about what was best. As a result, I ended up in an environment that satisfied my intellectual curiosity. I think I was lucky.


## Impact of the Minecraft Cup
So what happened after that? Surprisingly, I'm now a university student. I'm at [[en/works/keio|Keio University, Faculty of Environment and Information Studies (SFC)]], a place where someone who had trouble with school can attend almost perfectly. It's fun.

I was relatively bad at general studies (the usual classes up to high school), but I was confident I could do my favorite things endlessly. Recently, these kinds of individualities have been recognized, and can be leveraged in university admissions (called AO admissions at Keio). University is truly a wonderful place where you can study and pursue only what you love and are interested in.

### What happened after the Minecraft Cup
- It started with a part-time job at a programming school ([[en/works/yago.inc|part-time at a programming school]]).
- Then, based on issues I learned about through programming education, I applied to and was accepted as a [[en/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]] and with what I made there I entered and won an award at the [[en/accomplishments/teens-apps-awards|Apps Koshien 2024]].
- After that I entered [[en/works/keio|Keio University, Faculty of Environment and Information Studies (SFC)]].

I think it's a very good outcome that what I gained from the Minecraft Cup has taken these forms. Of course the Minecraft Cup isn't everything — I've met various people elsewhere too — but I'm sure it was one contributing factor.

I'm now older than the participation age for the Minecraft Cup, so I'd like to work on expanding that community more globally. I'm sometimes busy with university and my own projects, so I can't always be around, but I'll help as much as I can! I'm based in Tokyo and sometimes show up at events, so feel free to say hi.
