Sometimes you just want to create a blog site, right?

For sites of moderate size, we're now in an era where you can quickly create your own custom website without having to use WordPress. Today, we'll use **Astro**, a trending framework, to create a blog website in about an hour.

## What is Astro? {#28572507-ed4c-4fb7-8db0-050379e7f50c}

Astro is a **framework** for building fast websites primarily focused on content delivery (blogs, articles, etc.). It's best suited for sites meant for viewing content.
It also incorporates the concept of **islands**, which allows you to load JavaScript for **specific parts** of your site to enable interactivity when buttons are clicked. While there's more to it, essentially it's a framework that's **easy to use and highly extensible**, perfect for beginners.

### What's a Framework? {#5e61d161-8030-48e1-9e3d-e81d4987baf0}

If you're wondering what a framework is, simply put, it's like an **app development kit packed with useful features**. Using this allows you to **skip all sorts of preparation** and jump right into development.
