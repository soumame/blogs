Sometimes you just want to create a blog site, right?

For sites of moderate size, we're now in an era where you can quickly create your own custom website without having to use WordPress. Today, we'll use **Astro**, a trending framework, to create a blog website in about an hour.

## What is Astro?
Astro is a **framework** primarily designed for building fast websites focused on content delivery (blogs, articles, etc.). It's suitable for sites mainly intended for viewing.
It also incorporates the concept of **islands**, which allows you to load JavaScript for **specific parts** of your site, enabling interactive features like button clicks. While we'll skip the details, essentially it's a framework that's **easy to use and highly extensible**, perfect for beginners.

### What's a Framework?!
If you're wondering what a framework is, simply put, it's like a **development kit packed with various useful features**. Using it allows you to **skip all kinds of preparation** and start right away.
