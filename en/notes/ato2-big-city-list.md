# [ATO2] List of the Most Important Early-Game Cities (Updating)

I created a list of cities you should secure in the early game. Please take a look if you'd like. They are categorized into six regions — Asia, Middle East, Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Australia — and I note each city's economic scale (the sum of business and tourism levels) and other details. I list them roughly in the order you should prioritize (including places with less competition and that are easier to contend for), but this may vary, so please understand.
