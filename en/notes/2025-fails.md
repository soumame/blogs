I do this every year, and I'm doing it again this year. It's a session where I expose my personal failures.

By the way, [[2024-fails|last year]] I made a pretty bad mistake by focusing too much on [[blogs/en/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]] and not thinking about where I'd continue my studies. (I did end up deciding on a path, but I panicked quite a bit.)

As with last time, I'll briefly look back at a few events that were **failures** for me this year (where the approach was poor or the circumstances unfavorable, and the goals weren't achieved)
This is template!!!
I think. This year had many things that went well, but I'm already tired of endlessly posting shiny, self-promotional stuff like “I won such-and-such!” There is a lot to learn, yet the internet is full of stories about people who succeeded. ~~Apparently taking pleasure in others' misfortunes reduces one's feelings of inferiority and provides reassurance by realizing "that person isn't actually that great; they're just human like me," so...~~

Let's take a look.
