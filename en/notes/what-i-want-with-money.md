# What Would I Do If I Had a Lot of Money

I used to think about all the different things I could do if I had money. But that was just a fantasy - in reality, when I actually buy services or products with money, I'm really happy at first, but that feeling fades after about three days.

## **Is Having a Lot of Money Really Happiness?**

While we envy the super-rich, are they truly happy?

For example, when it comes to smartphones, I felt the same excitement whether I bought a Â¥70,000 iPhone or a suspicious Â¥20,000 knockoff phone. That's just my personal opinion though.

And with both phones, the excitement wore off after about three days. Because there were no new discoveries, it just became boring.

## Let's Buy Happiness with Money!

Recently, I saw this presentation at an event:

According to this person, the amount of money isn't that important.

Particularly, spending on others brings happiness.

Humans apparently feel happiness by connecting with other humans.

I can certainly relate to this.

Relationships with others... using money for relationships with others... can't think of many good ways lol

...while thinking about this, I found another good article.

According to this article, spending money on travel gives you a greater sense of happiness.

I see!!

## Travel is the Greatest Happiness

According to these three articles, the best way to spend money is to buy experiences like travel and share them with someone. Looking at travel memories brings back feelings gradually, and you can indulge in nostalgia thinking "Ah... back then I was..."

...in other words, what I want to say is that I want to go traveling tomorrow. 1011-500
