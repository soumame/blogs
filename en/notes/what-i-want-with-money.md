# What Would I Do If I Had a Lot of Money

I used to think about all the different things I could do if I had money. But that was just a fantasy. In reality, when I buy services or products with money, I'm really happy at first, but after about three days, that excitement fades away.

## **Is Having a Lot of Money Really Happiness?**

While we envy the super-rich, are they truly happy?

For example, the excitement I felt when buying a Â¥70,000 iPhone versus a suspicious Â¥20,000 smartphone was the same. That's just my personal opinion though.

Moreover, with both purchases, the excitement wore off after about three days. Because there were no new discoveries, it just became boring.

## Let's Buy Happiness with Money!

Recently, I saw this presentation at an event:

According to this person, the amount of money isn't that important.

Particularly, spending on others brings happiness.

Humans apparently feel happiness by connecting with other humans.

I can certainly relate to this.

Relationships with others... using money for relationships with others... can't think of many good ways! ðŸ˜…

...while thinking about this, I found another good article.

According to this article, spending money on travel brings greater happiness.

I see!!

## Travel is the Greatest Happiness

According to these three articles, the best way to spend money is to buy experiences like travel and share them with someone else. When you look at travel records, memories slowly come back, and you can indulge in nostalgia thinking "Ah... back then I was..."

...in other words, what I want to say is that I want to go traveling tomorrow.
