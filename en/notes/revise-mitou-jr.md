# Reflecting on Mitou Junior

> This article is part of the [Mitou Junior Advent Calendar](https://adventar.org/calendars/10825).

Hello everyone, this is Soumame ([https://tokumaru.work/ja](https://tokumaru.work/ja)). I was attending an Australian international school in Malaysia and graduated at the end of November.
As 2024 is coming to an end, I'm reflecting on various things I've done this year.

Today, I'd like to casually look back on the Mitou Junior creator support program that I completed in November this year, from how it started to how it progressed. If you don't know about Mitou Junior, please check out their website.

## It Started with Watching Mitou Junior's Final Presentation
The reason I applied to Mitou Junior goes back more than two years. In November 2022, I went to watch the final presentation with a friend I had just met that day.

> It's a program that supports students aged 17 and under, including junior high, high school, and technical college students, who have original ideas and outstanding technical skills. The Mitou Project is a talent development program run by IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency) under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for young people under 24, and Mitou Junior was established and is operated primarily by Mitou Project graduates. Since its start in 2016, we have received 860 applications and supported/selected 136 creators.
