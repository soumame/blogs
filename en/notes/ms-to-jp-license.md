Hello, I'm Souma, 18 years old.
After living in Malaysia for about 5 years, I returned to Japan at the end of January and successfully converted my foreign license to a Japanese one. I can now drive in Japan, so I'd like to document the process here.

> As of March 2025, there has been an increase in foreign license conversion applications, and the rules have changed. Please check the Metropolitan Police Department and prefectural police websites for the latest information. The information on this page is based on personal experience. If you notice any errors, please let me know.
