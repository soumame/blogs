Hello, I'm Soumame, 18 years old.
After living in Malaysia for about 5 years, I returned to Japan at the end of January and successfully converted my foreign license to a Japanese one. Here's my experience with driving in Japan.

> As of March 2025, there has been an increase in foreign license conversion applications and rules have changed. Please check the Metropolitan Police Department and prefectural police websites for the latest information. The information on this page is based on personal experience. Please let me know if you notice any errors.
