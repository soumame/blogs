# What is VCE, the curriculum offered in Victoria, Australia?

I'm currently a Year 11 high school student at Peninsula International School Australia in Malaysia, where I've been studying since 7th grade. I wanted to organize my thoughts about "VCE," the Victorian curriculum we're studying, as it's quite complicated.

## What is VCE {#2dfaa0c8-8f77-40e4-a697-aab2d100dc3b}

First, VCE is an educational certificate provided by Victoria, the Australian state famous for Melbourne.

Australian higher education goes up to Year 12, and VCE starts after completing Year 10, taking the final two years to complete. As some might notice, VCE is longer compared to other curricula.

Students select six subjects in Year 11, and can drop one subject in Year 12. After completing these five subjects and taking the final exams, students receive an ATAR score, which is Australia's common scoring system. This score can then be used to enter Australian universities.

### About ATAR {#4a778300-e20f-4a4a-8414-3c0484c3ec48}

Here's a good link about ATAR:

## VCE Advantages and Disadvantages {#41e413bd-8eb1-41ac-9d28-ce7241144ac2}

The biggest advantage of VCE is that it offers **elective subjects**.
Unlike in Japan where certain subjects are mandatory, in VCE you can **improve your scores by choosing subjects you're good at** (though some core subjects are required).
Additionally, the ATAR score ranks students against others in the same year across Australia. For example, a score of 80 means you're in the top 20%, 90 means top 15%. This provides a relatively fair measure of academic ability.

The main disadvantage is its high difficulty level. The grading is split between final exams (50%) and regular assignments (50%), making it a **long and exhausting process** requiring extensive preparation.
Also, the final exam is one-shot with no retakes, so that score stays with you forever.
Furthermore, **VCE is less well-known compared to IGCSE or IB**, and naturally, ATAR scores aren't accepted in many countries outside Australia. If returning to Japan, additional tests like TOEFL are required.

Another point, which could be either an advantage or disadvantage, is that since it goes up to Year 12, you **don't need to attend college** (foundation, diploma, or pre-u programs) **(this turned out to be a major disadvantage for me, as I'll explain later)**.
