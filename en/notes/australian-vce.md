# The curriculum offered in Victoria, Australia — What is the VCE?

I'm currently a Year 11 high school student who has attended Peninsula International School Australia in Malaysia since Year 7, and the Victorian curriculum we study there, called the "VCE," is pretty confusing. I wanted to整理 my information for myself, so I'm writing it down here.

## What is the VCE
First, as a premise, the VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) is a certificate provided by the state of Victoria in Australia, which is famous for Melbourne.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education)

Australian secondary education goes up to Year 12, and the VCE is completed over the final two years, so it starts after Year 10. If you've noticed already — yes, the VCE is longer than other curricula.

You choose six subjects around Year 11, and in Year 12 you can drop one subject. You then complete the remaining five subjects and take final exams to receive an ATAR score, which is a nationwide Australian score. You use that score to enter Australian universities.

### About ATAR
Someone wrote a pretty good explanation of ATAR, so here's the link:

## Advantages and disadvantages of the VCE
The biggest advantage of the VCE is that it's based on **elective subjects**. In Japan there are subjects you have to take whether you like them or not, but with the VCE you can choose subjects you're good at to raise your scores. (There are some compulsory subjects, though.)

Also, the ATAR score calculated from this ranks students in the same year across Australia. For example, a score of 80 means you're in the top 20%, and 90 means the top 15%. So it measures academic ability relatively fairly.

The downside is the difficulty. The weighting is 50% final exam and 50% regular assessments, so it requires long periods of sustained work and test preparation, making it a **long slog and really tiring**. The final exam is a one-shot exam and cannot be retaken, so that score follows you.

Also, **its recognition is much lower compared to IGCSE or IB**, and unsurprisingly many countries outside Australia do not accept ATAR scores. If you return to Japan, you may need to take additional tests such as TOEFL.

Another point that could be a pro or a con is that because it runs through Year 12, you **don't need to go to college** (places called foundation, diploma, or pre-u). (As I'll describe later, this was a big disadvantage for me.)

## Don't take VCE in Malaysia!! It's trash!!
...After weighing the pros and cons, VCE itself actually seemed possibly better than Japan in some ways, but unfortunately in my circumstances everything worked out badly.

As I mentioned at the start, I'm taking the VCE at Peninsula International School Australia in Malaysia. At this school teachers are being poached by other schools and are in short supply, and there are very few teachers who are well-versed in VCE. (Is this the case at other schools too?) Because of that, the textbooks and materials don't seem very aligned with VCE, and VCE-style exams still appear for tests, so for some subjects you end up relying heavily on self-study. (Of course there are good teachers as well.)

Because of that, the range of elective subjects you can choose from is **very limited**. Until last year there were Art and Data Analytics (equivalent to computing), but those were removed this year. As a result, options shrank and taking the remaining science subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) has become effectively mandatory, so it feels like being forced into the sciences. If you love math and science that's fine, but I don't really like them... (I'll do my best.)

The clincher is transfer rules. Generally, at other schools (those offering IGCSE, etc.) it's common to attend a college—a pre-university education provider—after finishing Year 10 or Year 11, and because VCE covers content equivalent to IGCSE by Year 10, **until 2020** you could either go to college after Year 10 or continue with VCE. If you planned to go to Australia, VCE was fine, but if you were going to another country, more common routes like A-levels or the local equivalents might be better. However, starting in 2021 the Malaysian government changed its policy: students following Australian curricula including VCE are required to go directly to university only after completing Year 12. See the PDF attached on the MQA link for details.

So yeah, if you're not set on going to Australia and you don't know which country you'll end up in, IGCSE or similar will definitely give you more options. I regret taking the VCE. I didn't investigate properly at the time. I realized this too late. I should have been suspicious when I couldn't find any information about VCE anywhere.

If anyone reading this knows anything about the VCE, please let me know. If there's anything incorrect in this article, I'd appreciate being told on Twitter (X) or elsewhere.
