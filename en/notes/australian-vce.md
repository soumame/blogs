# What is VCE, the curriculum offered in Victoria, Australia?

I'm currently a Year 11 high school student attending Peninsula International School Australia in Malaysia since 7th grade, and I wanted to organize information about "VCE," the Victorian curriculum we're studying, as it's quite complicated even for me.

## What is VCE?
First, as a premise, VCE is an educational certificate provided by Victoria, the Australian state famous for Melbourne.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Certificate_of_Education)

Australian higher education goes up to Year 12, and VCE takes the last two years to complete, starting after Year 10. As some might have noticed, yes, VCE is longer compared to other curricula.

Students select six subjects in Year 11, and in Year 12, they can drop one subject. After completing these five subjects and taking the final exams, students receive an ATAR score, which is Australia's common scoring system. This score can then be used to enter Australian universities.

### About ATAR
Here's a good link about ATAR:

## Advantages and Disadvantages of VCE
The biggest advantage of VCE is that it offers **elective subjects**.
Unlike in Japan where you have to take certain subjects whether you like it or not, in VCE, you can **improve your scores by choosing subjects you're good at**. (There are some mandatory subjects)
Also, the ATAR score ranks students against their peers across Australia. For example, a score of 80 means you're in the top 20%, 90 means top 15%. This provides a relatively fair measure of academic ability.

The disadvantage is its high difficulty level. The grading is split between final exams (50%) and regular assignments (50%), which makes it **a long-term battle and really tiresome** as it requires extended preparation time for tests.
Also, the final exam is one-shot with no retakes possible, so that score stays with you forever.
Additionally, it has **much lower recognition compared to IGCSE or IB**, and naturally, ATAR scores aren't accepted in many countries outside Australia. If returning to Japan, you'll need additional tests like TOEFL.

Whether it's an advantage or disadvantage is debatable, but since it goes up to Year 12, you **don't need to go to college** (foundation, diploma, or pre-u programs). **(This turned out to be a major disadvantage for me, as I'll explain later)**
