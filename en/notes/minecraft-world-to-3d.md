Since this topic is frequently asked about, I'm compiling it in this note. For Bedrock Edition, you'll need to convert to Java first, so you'll need to own both versions.

### Requirements {#e5f02d28-49d8-46ec-9473-bd0480e02ed0}

* Minecraft Java Edition
* PC/Mac or device that can run applications
* Java Runtime Environment

Please install anything you're missing.

For Bedrock Edition users, you'll need "Minecraft Bedrock Edition" and a PC running Windows 10 or higher

### Step 1 - Prepare Your World {#4aaf7c87-7264-444c-bfd6-24e8d97a83fb}

(I assume you already have a world since you're here to convert one to 3D...)
If you want to try this out, you can generate a new world

For Education Edition users, you'll need to convert it to MCpack format and change the extension to extract the DB file, then convert it to Bedrock format. **If you're unsure about this process, I recommend not touching the DB files as it might corrupt your Minecraft world.**

### Step 2 (Bedrock Only) - Convert to Java Edition World {#d4feaf23-65bf-4f72-aab6-1f02f2bb4ee4}

We'll use a dedicated app to convert the world. The first option I'll introduce is "je2be" which is free. The second option is a paid tool called Universal Minecraft Tool. Here, I'll explain the process using je2be.

Install and open the app, click "Bedrock to Java" and you'll see a list of worlds like this:

Select your desired world from the list and start the conversion.
