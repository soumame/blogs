Well, the year is finally coming to an end~ It was a long yet short year, is what I wanted to say, but I received **this mention** in **my Discord community "Mamee"**.

So, I decided to **look back on what happened this year**, but since it wouldn't be fun to seriously write promotional-like content like "I did XX activities!", I'll write about some of the **failures** (where methods were wrong or circumstances were bad, and goals weren't achieved) that happened to me this year. Since they say **misery loves company**, please enjoy.
