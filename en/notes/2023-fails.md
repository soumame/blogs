Just when I was about to say "Well, this year is finally ending~ it was a long yet short year," I received **this mention** in **my Discord community "Mamee"**.

*Let's write a year-end review article!!!!!
Everyone should write one*

So, I decided to **look back on what happened this year**, but since it wouldn't be fun to seriously write promotional-like content like "I did XX activities!", I'll reflect on some of the **failures** (where methods were wrong or circumstances were bad, and goals weren't achieved) that happened to me this year. As they say, **misery loves company**, so please enjoy.
