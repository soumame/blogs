# Looking Back at Only My Failures in 2023!

> For those thinking "Isn't this just your opinion?" - Yes, you're right. This post mainly contains personal experiences and thoughts. For brevity, I've omitted some detailed explanations. If you have any questions, please research on your own first and then feel free to DM me.

I was about to say "Well, another year is ending, it's been a long yet short year," when I received **this mention** in **"Mamee," the Discord community I run**:

_Let's write year-end reflection articles!!!!!!!!
Everyone should write one_

So, I decided to **look back on this year's events**, but rather than seriously writing promotional-like content like "I did this activity!", I thought I'd reflect on some of my **failures** (where methods were wrong or circumstances were bad, and goals weren't achieved) from this year. Since they say **misery loves company**, please enjoy.

## 1: Failed Attempt to Make Money with Learn+ Subscription ðŸ˜­

Last year, as a **student ambassador** for the IDEACTIVE JAPAN PROJECT business contest (more like a hackathon), I had the opportunity to do marketing for elementary school students and hosted events using Minecraft. Seeing many elementary school students enjoying Minecraft, I had an idea: **Let's start a business targeting them!**

### Learn+ - Not Exactly Empty, But...

So I started **a service called Learn+.** It was like an **online salon** where participants would receive **exclusive content and videos**. Initially, I thought no one would join, but surprisingly, **several people registered even though there was no content yet.**
From there, I tried to provide content, **but** since it wasn't a company operation and was run only by students with no real business focus, the priority gradually decreased, and **after a few months, events and content provision stopped.** It kind of faded away gradually. ðŸ˜­

_We used to hold online events in the past._
