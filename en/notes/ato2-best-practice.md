**Note: This article is still being written and content may change in the future.**

I'll introduce the most successful strategies I've found after reading various articles and trying them out. Since there are many technical terms, beginners should refer to the wiki.

## First Turn (1960s) Strategy

**Buy as many TU104s as possible from the start until they're discontinued**, and lease as many 707-120s as possible. Converting credits to cash is also an option if needed.
Then, purchase 1 707F and create ultra-short-distance routes between major cities to complete two cargo quests in the first turn. Purchase more if possible
(Examples: London-Paris, New York-Boston, etc.)
When TU104 production ends, replace high-demand routes (monopoly routes between major cities) with 737s and 727s. As income increases, focus on buying DC-8-62s and 707s.

Only lease 707s, no need to purchase them.

Leased 707s **don't contribute to company value** and are **disadvantageous**, so **sell all leases around 1975. Don't use leasing anymore after this.**

## 1971

**Sell all previously purchased TU104s**. From here, switch to **long-distance and cargo focus**.

Routes **over 7000km become profitable** now. Move DC-8 series to smaller routes due to lower seat capacity, use 747-100 for Tokyo-London scale routes, and if **peak season net profit exceeds 500,000**, develop ultra-long-distance routes like Tokyo-New York. **Sometimes there are heavy spenders**, so in such cases, **give up** and **aim for second place**. **DC-10-30F releases in 1971**. It's an **extremely powerful aircraft**, so purchase 10-20 per turn. This urgency is because the economy worsens in 1972, reducing income by half. If you still have surplus funds, purchase IL-62Ms and establish routes for future use. Keep the fleet to around 30 aircraft due to low value and satisfaction.
