We refined the project "TomoMeet" that we created at [[tomodachi|TOMODACHI Boeing Entrepreneurship Seminar 2025]] and participated in “Gikuhaku”, an event for interacting with other participants and teams.

We also received sponsor awards from CARTA HOLDINGS Inc. and Yumemi (Accenture) during Gikuhaku.
