## What is App Koshien?
> "App Koshien" is an app development contest that has been held since 2011 with the aim of discovering and supporting the healthy development of young creators who will lead the next generation.

> In the finals, elementary, middle and high school app developers who have advanced through the development division gather to give public presentations.
In past competitions, judges active in various fields evaluate the planning capabilities of the apps,
then score implementation skills while actually operating the apps on devices and checking the source code to select outstanding works.

> Every year, future stars emerge from the competition.

## Results

In the App Koshien finals, you have to memorize your presentation (at least that was the case in 2024). I'm really bad at memorization, so honestly it was terrible.
Although I ended up winning, personally I couldn't memorize the presentation well and couldn't perform to my full potential, making it a somewhat bitter experience. I can remember the flow of the presentation, but memorizing it word for word was impossible for me.
I think I'm not as good as others at conveying what I want to say in a limited time, so basically, whenever I give presentations, I always write a script and read from it. I carefully think about it beforehand, choose the words to convey my message, and try to deliver it in a way I'm satisfied with. So I don't really want to think up words on the spot that aren't in my script. (While it might get the message across, I feel like I might use awkward phrasing or make it harder to understand)

Since I've never had to completely memorize a presentation outside of App Koshien, I'm taking this as a learning experience.
