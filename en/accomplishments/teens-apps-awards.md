## What is App Koshien

> "App Koshien" is an app development contest held since 2011 with the aim of discovering and fostering young creators who will lead the next generation.
>
> In the finals, middle and high school app developers who have advanced through the development category gather to give public presentations.  
> In past competitions, judges active in various fields evaluate the app's planning,  
> then assess implementation skills by actually operating the app on devices and reviewing the source code, selecting outstanding works.
>
> Every year, future stars emerge from the competition.

At App Koshien, you have to memorize your presentation for the finals (at least that was the case in 2024). I'm really bad at memorization, so to be honest it was terrible.

Well, we ended up winning, but personally I couldn't remember the presentation at all, couldn't fully bring out my performance, and it was a somewhat bitter experience. I can remember the overall flow of the presentation, but it's impossible for me to memorize it line by line.

I think I'm worse than others at fully conveying what I want to say within a limited time, so basically I always write a script for presentations and read it aloud. I take time beforehand to carefully think, choose the words to convey my message, and try to present in a way I'm satisfied with. So I don't really want to make up words on the spot that aren't in the script. (They may convey the idea, but I feel they can lead to awkward phrasing or make it harder to understand.)

Until App Koshien, I had never needed to memorize a presentation word-for-word, so I guess it was an experience.
