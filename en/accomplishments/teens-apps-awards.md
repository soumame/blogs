## What is App Koshien

> “App Koshien” is an app development contest held since 2011 with the aim of discovering and supporting the healthy development of young creators who will lead the next generation.

> At the finals, the student app developers (elementary, junior high, and high school) who advanced from the development division gather and give public presentations.  
> In past competitions, judges active in various fields evaluated the app's planning,  
> and then assessed implementation skills by actually operating the app on devices and reviewing source code, selecting outstanding works.

> Every year, future stars emerge from the competition.

App Koshien's finals require memorizing your presentation (at least that was the case in 2024). I'm really bad at memorization, so honestly it was the worst.
Well, we ended up winning, but personally I couldn't remember the presentation at all, couldn't bring out my full performance, and it turned into a somewhat bitter experience. I can remember the overall flow of the presentation, but memorizing it line by line is impossible for me.
I think I'm worse than others at fully conveying everything I want to say within a limited time, so basically, for presentations I always write a script and read it while presenting. I take time beforehand to think carefully, choose the words to convey my message, and try to present in a way that satisfies me. So I don't really want to come up with words on the spot that aren't in the script. (They get the point across, but I feel I might use odd phrasing or make it harder to understand.)

I had never before needed to memorize a presentation word-for-word outside of App Koshien, so I think this was an experience in itself.
