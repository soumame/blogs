[[en/misc/minecraftcup|Minecraft Cup]] is a digital making contest held in Japan for children from elementary to high school. Using Minecraft Education, participants create theme-based works and compete with entries from across Japan and abroad.

I competed with a few friends, showcasing Minecraft technical skills and problem-solving; we were finalists and received the Impress "Children and IT" award.

Participating in the Minecraft Cup was a major turning point for me. In particular, it’s no exaggeration to say that it was the catalyst for my 2024 [[en/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]] opportunity. During the pandemic I couldn’t leave home, and it started as a small chance to participate with friends 😆

As of 2025, as a (graduate?) alum I help out with the organizer, the [[en/works/dmcouncil|Digital Monozukuri Council (DMCouncil)]]. I assist at events held around the Kanto area and sometimes make appearances, so please look for me.
