[[en/misc/minecraftcup|Minecraft Cup]] is a digital making contest held in Japan for children from elementary through high school that uses Minecraft: Education Edition to create works based on themes and compete by accepting submissions from across Japan and overseas.

I competed with a few friends in a competition testing Minecraft technical skills and problem-solving, and we were finalists and received the Impress Kids and IT Award.

As finalists, we were also interviewed and covered by the media.

Participating in the Minecraft Cup was a major turning point for me. In particular, it's not an exaggeration to say that this was the catalyst for my 2024 [[en/accomplishments/mitoujr-2024|Mitou Junior]]. During the pandemic I couldn't leave home, and it started as a small occasion of joining with friends 😆

As of 2025, as something of an alumnus, I'm helping out with various activities at the organizing body, the [[en/works/dmcouncil|Digital Manufacturing Council (DMCouncil)]]. I assist at events held around the Kanto area and make appearances there, so please look for me.
