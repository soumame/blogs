While Japan has the Minecraft Cup competition for Minecraft: Education Edition, similar events exist overseas. In Malaysia, there's an event called MEC (Minecraft Education Challenge). I participated in [MEC 2023](https://mcedumy.com/mec-2023) and won second place.

## Malaysia's Minecraft Cup!?

Works that passed the preliminary screening were selected for the finals, and the event was held at sponsor Sunway Malls' venue

Representatives from the Ministry of Education came to give speeches personally, and it was quite an elaborate event for its first iteration.

We received an incredibly large trophy.

## Two Years Later in 2025...

Now, after about two years, I'm helping operate the Minecraft Cup in Japan. I've realized that overseas, especially in Asia, there's growing recognition of the importance of IT education and digital creation education, and Minecraft is incredibly useful in these areas.

From my experience participating, I noticed that the level of submissions isn't quite as high as Japan's yet, and most participants were from urban areas, highlighting regional disparities (though Malaysia is a very large country, so bridging these gaps will be quite challenging).

Currently, the Minecraft Cup is limited to Japan, and the international block doesn't have many applicants yet, but I think expanding overseas could be a possibility for the future.
