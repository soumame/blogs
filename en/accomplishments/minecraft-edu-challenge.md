In Japan there's a contest for Minecraft: Education Edition called the Minecraft Cup, but there are similar examples overseas. In Malaysia, there is an event called the MEC (Minecraft Education Challenge). I entered [MEC 2023](https://mcedumy.com/mec-2023) and won second place.

## A Minecraft Cup in Malaysia!?

Works that passed the preliminary screening were selected for the final competition held on the day, and the event took place at the sponsor Sunway Malls' venue.

Officials from the Ministry of Education personally came to give greetings, and for a first-time event it was surprisingly well-produced.

I also received a huge trophy.

I took a photo holding a board that read NAIB JOHAN (Runner-up).

## In 2025...

So, about two years later, I'm now helping to run the Minecraft Cup in Japan. Events like this abroad—especially in Asia—show that the importance of information education and digital making education is being recognized, and I think Minecraft is really useful for those purposes.

From actually participating, I felt that the level of submissions was still not as high as in Japan, and most participants came from urban areas, so I felt a regional disparity (however, Malaysia is a very large country, so closing that gap will be very difficult).

Currently the Minecraft Cup is limited to Japan, and the overseas blocks don't have a large number of applicants, but I think expanding overseas in the future is something worth considering.
