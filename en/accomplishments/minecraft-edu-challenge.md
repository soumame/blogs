In Japan, there is a Minecraft contest called the Minecraft Cup, and similar events exist overseas. In Malaysia, there is an event called MEC (Minecraft Education Challenge). I participated in [MEC 2023](https://mcedumy.com/mec-2023) and won the runner-up prize.

## Malaysia's Minecraft Cup!?

Works that passed the preliminary screening were selected for the final tournament held at the venue sponsored by Sunway Malls.

Officials from the Ministry of Education came to greet us personally, making it a well-organized event for a first-time occasion.

I received a huge trophy as well.

I took a photo holding the NAIB JOHAN (runner-up) board.

## Two Years Later in 2025...

So, two years later, I am currently helping to run the Minecraft Cup in Japan. It's recognized that information education and digital making are essential in overseas, especially in Asia. I believe that Minecraft can be extremely useful in these areas.

From my experience, I felt that the level of works was not yet as high as in Japan, and most participants came from urban areas, highlighting regional disparities. (However, Malaysia is a very large country, so bridging this gap is quite challenging.)

Currently, the Minecraft Cup is limited to Japan, and there aren't many applicants from overseas, but I think exploring opportunities abroad could be a good idea in the future.
