We developed, as a team, a piece of software called TomoMeet to foster real-life connections at event venues.

This seminar consisted of a hackathon (closer to an ideathon) held in September, followed by a three-month refinement period.

I haven't had many experiences building something with a team formed on the spot, and it was a lot of fun.
