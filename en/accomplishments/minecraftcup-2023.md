A world created by Team Ippanjin, a team composed of members ranging from elementary to high school students who operate on the internet, received an Encouragement Award at the Minecraft Cup regional tournament held in Japan.

The Encouragement Award is given at the regional tournament — where teams that passed the preliminaries compete — to recognize teams expected to do well in the future.

Two years after the [[en/accomplishments/minecraftcup-2021|previous tournament]], we took on the challenge again. Even creating and submitting a work under such tight time constraints is impressive on its own, but the quality has improved significantly compared to two years ago.

For various reasons, we unfortunately did not advance to the national tournament, but this was a major turning point that has led to subsequent activities.
